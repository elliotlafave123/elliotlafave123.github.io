            did it all without any help. I am very passionate about computing and coding and i like to develop my own software and websites.

            Youth club<br><br>
            In my local youth group I have participated in many activities that taught me many skills. Recently our group won a buzz award for our
            clean air project where we made posters to show people the damage that is being caused to the earth. I have also helped out by writing and printing
            out letters to send out to people who attend the group.
