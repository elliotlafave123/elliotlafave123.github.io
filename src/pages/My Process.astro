    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    <p>
      Building a website requires a well-defined process that ensures the final product is functional and aesthetically
      pleasing. As a website developer, I've developed a process that leverages the Agile methodology to ensure the
      delivery of high-quality websites that meet my clients' needs. Here is an overview of my website development
      process.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article__section" id="The Agile Principles">
    <h2>The Agile Principles</h2>
    <p>
      The Agile principles are a set of values and principles that guide the development of software. These principles
      include:
    </p>

    <div class="article__user-story">
      <ul class="u-margin-bottom-medium">
        <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
        <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
        <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
        <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      I apply these principles in my website development process to ensure that I deliver high-quality websites that
      meet my clients' needs. For example, I prioritize communication and collaboration with clients and team members to
      ensure that everyone is on the same page, and I adapt to changing requirements quickly.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article__section" id="RequirementsGathering">
    <h2>Requirements Gathering</h2>
    <p>
      The first step in my website development process is to gather requirements for the application. This involves
      meeting with clients to identify their goals, target audience, and the features they want in their website. I use
      a combination of techniques such as interviews, surveys, and prototyping to ensure I understand the client's
      requirements fully. This helps me define the scope of the project and establish clear goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      To ensure that the requirements are captured accurately, I use a user story format. User stories are a simple way
      to describe a feature from the perspective of the user. They help me understand what the user wants to achieve and
      why. A user story typically follows the format:
    </p>

    <div class="article__user-story">
      <p class="u-margin-bottom-medium">
        As a <span class="u-bold">user type</span>, I want to <span class="u-bold">perform an action</span> so that I can
        <span class="u-bold">achieve a goal</span>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Once I have gathered all the requirements, I create a prioritized list of features and requirements. This helps me
      manage the scope of the project and ensure that the most critical features are developed first. I work closely
      with the client to ensure that they are involved in the process and have a clear understanding of the project's
      goals and requirements.
    </p>

    <p>Some of the techniques I use for requirements gathering include:</p>

    <div class="article__user-story">
      <ul class="u-margin-bottom-medium">
        <li>Interviews with stakeholders and users</li>
        <li>Surveys to gather feedback from users</li>
        <li>Competitor analysis to identify industry trends and best practices</li>
        <li>Prototyping to validate requirements and get feedback from users</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      By using a structured approach to requirements gathering, I can ensure that the website meets the client's needs
      and provides value to the users.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article__section" id="Design">
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>
      Once I have a clear understanding of the client's requirements, I move on to the design phase. In this phase, I
      create a wireframe, which is a visual representation of the website's layout, structure, and navigation. I also
      work on the website's visual design, such as the color scheme, typography, and imagery, to create a consistent and
      engaging user experience. This helps me to ensure that the website design meets the client's requirements and
      expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use design thinking approach to ensure that the website design is user-centric and aligns with the client's
      brand image. I start with the empathize stage, where I gather insights about the target audience and their needs.
      Then, I move on to the define stage, where I identify the key features and requirements of the website. In the
      ideate stage, I brainstorm and sketch ideas for the website design. I then create high-fidelity mockups using
      design tools such as Figma to get client feedback and refine the design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figma is a powerful design tool that enables me to create high-quality mockups and collaborate with clients
      seamlessly. With Figma, I can create interactive prototypes, share design files, and get feedback in real-time.
      This helps me to iterate quickly and ensure that the website design is aligned with the client's vision.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article__section" id="Development">
    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>
      With the design approved, I move on to the development phase, where I start building the website. My development
      process consists of several phases to ensure the website is developed efficiently and meets the client's
      requirements. These phases include:
    </p>
    <div class="article__user-story">
      <ul class="u-margin-bottom-medium">
        <li>Project setup</li>
        <li>Database design and development</li>
        <li>Front-end development</li>
        <li>Back-end development</li>
        <li>Integration and testing</li>
        <li>Deployment and support</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      During development, I use a variety of technologies to ensure the website is responsive, user-friendly, and
      maintainable. These technologies include:
    </p>
    <div class="article__user-story">
      <ul class="u-margin-bottom-medium">
        <li>ASP.NET Core</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>TypeScript</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <li>Vue</li>
        <li>Astro JS</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>SCSS</li>
        <li>NodeJs</li>
        <li>NPM</li>
        <li>IIS (Internet Information Services)</li>
        <li>Sitecore</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      I also use version control tools like Git to keep track of changes and ensure the codebase is maintainable. This
      helps me manage the codebase and collaborate with other developers, ensuring a streamlined and efficient
      development process.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article__section" id="Testing">
    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Although I don't use coded tests or frameworks for JavaScript, I do use xUnit in C# to test the back-end code. I
      add these tests to my continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions, which runs them automatically on
      deployment to ensure that any new changes to the code do not break the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to automated testing, I also perform manual testing to ensure that the application works as expected.
      I try to break the application by entering invalid input, navigating to different pages, and testing edge cases to
      ensure that the application is robust and can handle unexpected scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manual testing also allows me to ensure that the website looks and feels right. I check that the design is
      consistent across all pages, the website is responsive on different devices, and that the user experience is
      intuitive and user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, testing is a critical part of my website development process, and I take it seriously to ensure that the
      final product is high-quality and meets my clients' needs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article__section" id="Deployment">
    <h2>Deployment</h2>
    <p>
      The final step in my website development process is deploying the website. I primarily use Netlify for deploying
      static websites and IIS (Internet Information Services) for deploying ASP.NET Core websites to on-premises
      servers. Before deploying the website, I perform a series of tests to ensure that it is functioning correctly and
      meets the client's requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the website is deployed, I set up monitoring and logging tools such as Google Analytics or Microsoft
      Application Insights to monitor the website's performance and identify any issues early on. This allows me to
      proactively address any problems that may arise and ensure that the website is always up and running.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to monitoring, I provide ongoing support and maintenance to ensure that the website remains up to date
      and secure. This includes performing regular updates to the website's software and plugins, monitoring security
      vulnerabilities, and implementing necessary security measures such as SSL certificates and firewalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      By taking a proactive approach to deployment, monitoring, and maintenance, I ensure that my clients' websites
      remain secure, performant, and up to date. This helps to build long-term relationships with my clients and ensures
      that their websites continue to meet their needs over time.
    </p>
