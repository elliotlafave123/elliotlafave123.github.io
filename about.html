				<span class="packages_text_medium">About me</span><br><br>
				<span>I am a web designer who is starting up a web design business, I have made websites in the past as a hobby or for fun
				and now want to see if I can make it my future. I am a computer science student in high school and looking to study this further in college; I am looking for new clients who are willing to use my service and help me get my name out there.</span><br><br>

				<span>I hope to go on to work at a large web development company such as Google or would like to expand my own business to have multiple clients and people working here. I decided to start this company when I realised that there is a real gap in the market where low-cost web development for small businesses is just not available for most people. I will work hard to change this.</span><br><br>

				<span>My goal is to make the Internet accessible to all small businesses, I hope to do this by providing a high quality service
				at an affordable price. My service will allow your business to look more professional therefore increasing brand recognition
				and trust from your potential customers. I hope if you are reading this you get an idea of the type of business i'm trying to create and feel free to <a href="Contact.html">Contact Us</a> for more information or <a href="get_started.html">Get Started</a> today!</span><br><br>
